                A short while ago, a group of Silicon Valley "parentpreneurs" and "videologists" grew frustrated. While they
                could capture fleeting moments on video with ease that was once unimaginable, they had no control over how
                to find them again and who could see them. So they developed a platform to solve the problem. With VIBLIO,
                you can easily tag your videos, store them in the cloud and create private groups and communities for sharing
                life's best moments privately and as [browsing and buying through Amazon!].

            <br />
            <p>
                VIBLIO uses proprietary technology, called Magic Taggingâ„¢, to automatically categorize your video digital videos
                by a person in the video, certain activities, date or location. The application makes it easy to filter through
                videos in your VIBLIO library, and provides a private environment for you to share your videos to specific groups
                and communities that you create.

                VIBLIO makes your digital memories more manageable.
