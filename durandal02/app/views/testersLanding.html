                    VIBLIO is private &mdash; no one can see your videos unless you specifically share a video with someone.  VIBLIO is organized &mdash; you can easily filter through your videos by where they were taken or the faces in them!  VIBLIO is community &mdash; videos are a great way to engage your friends and family and now it is easy to create community shared albums using VIBLIO.
                </p>
                <p>* A VIBLIO video mashup is a mashup of video clips from all the videos in your album, stitched together in a fun short summary video.</p>
