It’s easy to upload your videos to VIBLIO with our iphone video uploader app.  It’s easy to organize them into privately shareable albums.  And now, it’s easy to get pictures directly from your videos with VIBLIO’s photo extractor.

                    VIBLIO is private &mdash; no one can see your videos unless you specifically share a video with someone.  VIBLIO is organized &mdash; you can easily filter through your videos by where they were taken or the faces in them!  VIBLIO is community &mdash; videos are a great way to engage your friends and family and now it is easy to create community shared albums using VIBLIO.
                </p>
                <p>* A VIBLIO video mashup is a mashup of video clips from all the videos in your album, stitched together in a fun short summary video.</p>
